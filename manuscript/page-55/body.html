No, there is very little music in the name Jack, if any at all, indeed.&nbsp; It does not thrill.&nbsp; It produces absolutely no vibrations . . . I have known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were more than usually plain.&nbsp; Besides, Jack is a notorious domesticity for John!&nbsp; And I pity any woman who is married to a man called John.&nbsp; She would probably never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a single moment&rsquo;s solitude.&nbsp; The only really safe name is Ernest.</p></div> </div>
