<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Algernon.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; But why does your aunt call you her uncle?&nbsp; &lsquo;From little Cecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is no objection, I admit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no matter what her size may be, should call her own nephew her uncle, I can&rsquo;t quite make out.&nbsp; Besides, your name isn&rsquo;t Jack at all; it is Ernest.</p><p>Jack.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t Ernest; it&rsquo;s Jack.</p><p>Algernon.&nbsp; You have always told me it was Ernest.&nbsp; I have introduced you to every one as Ernest.&nbsp; You answer to the name of Ernest.&nbsp; You look as if your name was Ernest.&nbsp; You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in my life.&nbsp; It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn&rsquo;t Ernest.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s on your cards.</p></div> </div>
