<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; In the second place, whenever I do dine there I am always treated as a member of the family, and sent down with either no woman at all, or two.&nbsp; In the third place, I know perfectly well whom she will place me next to, to-night.&nbsp; She will place me next Mary Farquhar, who always flirts with her own husband across the dinner-table.&nbsp; That is not very pleasant.&nbsp; Indeed, it is not even decent . . . and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase.&nbsp; The amount of women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly scandalous.&nbsp; It looks so bad.&nbsp; It is simply washing one&rsquo;s clean linen in public.&nbsp; Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I naturally want to talk to you about Bunburying.&nbsp; I want to tell you the rules.</p></div> </div>
