<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Lady Bracknell.&nbsp; That does not seem to me to be a grave objection.&nbsp; Thirty-five is a very attractive age.&nbsp; London society is full of women of the very highest birth who have, of their own free choice, remained thirty-five for years.&nbsp; Lady Dumbleton is an instance in point.&nbsp; To my own knowledge she has been thirty-five ever since she arrived at the age of forty, which was many years ago now.&nbsp; I see no reason why our dear Cecily should not be even still more attractive at the age you mention than she is at present.&nbsp; There will be a large accumulation of property.</p><p>Cecily.&nbsp; Algy, could you wait for me till I was thirty-five?</p></div> </div>
